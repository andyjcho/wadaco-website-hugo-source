Lead Levels in San Francisco Schools San Francisco Unified School District tested the school's drinking water for lead last year. This map shows the highest lead levels detected at each school based on multiple sample sites and dates.

There is no safe level of lead, especially for children. Even small amounts can lower IQ. Damage from lead exposure is irreversible.

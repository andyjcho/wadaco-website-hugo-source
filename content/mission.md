# Goals

## Igniting Student Innovation

The Water Data Collaborative is a student-led effort.
Students create and manage all activities of the Collaborative:
working on **research projects** with real-world challenges, partnership and societal impact;
organizing initiatives, **hackathons** and events enabling community outreach and knowledge exchange;
and developing **educational modules** addressing a wide range of topics connected with water data science.

## Building and Growing Partnerships

The Water Data Collaborative creates and facilitates contact between the diverse community of people and institutions involved in water data research,
with a particular emphasis on enabling knowledge exchange between data and domain experts.

## Pooling Water Data, Resources and Tools

Aggregating knowledge where it can be easily accessed is critical to enable a virtuous circle of continued development,
where new projects can reference, build on, and extend previous efforts.

The Water Data Collaborative addresses this challenge from multiple directions:

- Gathering and curating projects, code and other resources after the conclusion of the initiatives connected with water data;
- Collecting and maintaining curated water-related datasets;
- Developing software tools to improve the quality, performance and reproducibility of common tasks and workflows in water data research
